Linear Regression From Scratch (Sleep vs Exam Score)

This project implements linear regression from first principles to analyze the relationship between students’ sleep duration and exam performance. The workflow includes exploratory data analysis, correlation visualization, and model training using batch gradient descent without relying on machine learning libraries.

Features

Loads and processes real-world tabular data using Pandas

Computes and visualizes a correlation matrix with Seaborn

Implements gradient descent from scratch to minimize Mean Squared Error

Trains the model over 10,000 epochs to learn optimal parameters

Outputs the final regression equation

Visualizes both the dataset and the learned regression line

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Output

Correlation heatmap of numerical features

Scatter plot of sleep hours vs exam score

Best-fit regression line learned via gradient descent

Purpose

This project demonstrates a foundational understanding of machine learning concepts, including optimization, loss functions, and data visualization, by building a regression model without high-level ML frameworks.
